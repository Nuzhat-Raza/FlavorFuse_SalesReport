## Overview
I downloaded raw data from the internet and named it as my imaginary online food delivery app as Flavor Fuse. After cleaning the data, I performed data modeling and added calculated tables and columns like time intelligence. I also added Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for sales value and order numbers. The analysis includes a complete overview of sales data such as year-wise and city-wise breakdowns, user performance metrics, and geographical insights.
